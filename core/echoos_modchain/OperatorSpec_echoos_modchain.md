## Module Name:
echoos_modchain

## Phase:
Phase VI – Core Module

---

## Function Description:

This module is designed to manage modular chaining of semantic operators in EchoOS.  
It links multiple operators in a defined or conditional sequence and passes intermediate results through the execution chain.

---

## Capabilities (Planned):

- Load an operator execution sequence
- Dispatch each operator in turn, passing outputs to the next
- Support branching, skipping, or conditional execution (future)

---

## Input Format:
```json
{
  "chain": [
    {"op": "× FILTER.NOISE", "trace_path": "step1.jsonl"},
    {"op": "× EDGE", "trace_path": "step2.jsonl"}
  ]
}
```

---

## Output Format:
```json
{
  "status": "executed",
  "executed_steps": 2
}
```

---

## Implementation Path:
`/core/echoos_modchain.py`
