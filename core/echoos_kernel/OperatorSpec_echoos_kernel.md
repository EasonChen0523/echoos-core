## Module Name:
echoos_kernel

## Phase:
Phase VI – Core Module

---

## Function Description:

This module serves as the semantic runtime nucleus of EchoOS.  
It functions as a message and trace router between semantic operators and acts as a lightweight execution core for language logic.

---

## Capabilities:

- Dispatches execution calls to appropriate operators
- Logs execution metadata and updates semantic memory (if linked)
- Manages modular invocation chains
- Handles basic "run" interface for all phase modules

---

## Input Format:
```json
{
  "op": "× EDGE",
  "trace_path": "path/to/trace.jsonl"
}
```

---

## Output Format:
```json
{
  "status": "executed",
  "op": "× EDGE",
  "result_trace": [...]
}
```
