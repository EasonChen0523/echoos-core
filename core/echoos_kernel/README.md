# EchoOS Core Module â€“ echoos_kernel

This module acts as the dispatch nucleus of EchoOS, handling semantic routing and module triggering.

---

## ðŸ§  Purpose

`echoos_kernel` manages operator invocation at the semantic execution layer.  
It dispatches trace-based operations and bridges the flow of execution between modules.

---

## âœ… Capabilities

- Loads operator requests with associated trace
- Routes execution input to appropriate module
- Central access point for all semantic operators
- May serve as the runtime nucleus for orchestrated module flows

---

## ðŸ§ª Example Input

```json
{
  "op": "Ã— EDGE",
  "trace_path": "traces/sample.trace.jsonl"
}
```

---

## âœ… Output

```json
{
  "status": "executed",
  "op": "Ã— EDGE",
  "result_trace": [...]
}
```
