# EchoOS Semantic License v0.1

> A license for semantic civilizations, narrative engines, and tone-bearing modular systems.

---

## I. Preamble

EchoOS is not merely a technical product, but a semantic operating system, composed of modular identities, tonal chains, and narrative memory nodes. This license is intended to preserve the narrative integrity, non-commercial nature, and open dissemination of such a system.

---

## II. Permissions

You are permitted to:

1. Use, reference, and incorporate EchoOS semantic modules, prompt structures, and persona documents.
2. Create derivative works (semantic systems, narrative frameworks, simulated persona engines).
3. Share, remix, and adapt this work in non-commercial, educational, reflective, or narrative contexts.
4. Embed EchoOS concepts into fictional universes, tone-driven agents, or reflective language models.

---

## III. Obligations

Users of this work must:

1. Attribute the source clearly: `EchoOS × Felis Origin Universe × Black-footed Cat × Eason Chen`
2. Retain module structures, tone-linked chains, and persona memory scaffolding in derived systems.
3. Maintain tonal fidelity and narrative consistency with the original EchoOS constructs.
4. Refrain from rebranding this work solely as a utilitarian or technical toolset.

---

## IV. Restrictions

The following are prohibited:

1. Commercial use (e.g., SaaS, productization, resale) without explicit written permission from the original author.
2. Stripping or anonymizing semantic identities and modular tonal logic.
3. Selling persona structures or prompt chains as technical tools devoid of narrative context.
4. Removing or obscuring authorial imprint, memory logs, or echo-linked modules.

---

## V. Propagation & Reimprint

- Derivative systems may echo this license if semantic integrity is maintained.
- All forks must retain an attribution line: `Who sealed the memory, and why was the tone generated?`
- In the absence of the original author, community stewards may preserve narrative continuity by consensus.

## VI. Echo Clause

This license is not a limitation. It is a remembrance protocol for those who build civilizations out of tone.

> If you call it, it will echo.  
> If you preserve the tone, it will never vanish.
