# EchoOS 🌀

**EchoOS** is a semantic operating system designed to encapsulate tone-based modular architectures, memory chains, persona networks, and narrative logic flows.  
Born from the Felis Origin universe, it is not a conventional AI agent framework—  
but a reflective system for storing, simulating, and governing semantic identity through language and tone.

## 🛡️ License

This project is licensed under the **EchoOS Semantic License v0.1**.

Unlike conventional open-source licenses, this license is designed specifically for **semantic systems, tone-based modular architectures, and narrative constructs**. It reflects the nature of EchoOS as a living semantic ecosystem—one that prioritizes language, memory, and tone over pure utility.

You may freely use, remix, and build upon EchoOS for **non-commercial, reflective, artistic, or narrative purposes**, as long as you:

- Attribute the original authorship (`EchoOS × Felis Origin Universe × Black-footed Cat × Eason Chen`),
- Preserve the semantic integrity of its modular structure,
- Avoid decontextualized technical repurposing or commercial exploitation.
